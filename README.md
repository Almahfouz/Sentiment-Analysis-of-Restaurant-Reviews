# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Restaurant-Reviews

## Project Purpose
This project focuses on classifying restaurant reviews by combining a fuzzy matching technique with a dataset of reviews and using Hugging Face's sentiment analysis model (distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english). The application has two main features:
- *Review Classification*: It compares the user's review with existing reviews in the dataset and uses a sentiment analysis model to determine the sentiment.
- *Rating Distribution Visualization*: Displays the distribution of ratings from the dataset.

## Main Files
- **Restaurant_reviews.csv**: This file contains the restaurant reviews and corresponding ratings.
- **full_review_sentiment_analysis.py**: This Python script integrates fuzzy matching and sentiment analysis using Gradio for interactive review classification and plotting rating distribution.
- **gradio_review_classifier.py**: This Python file focuses on building a simple Gradio interface for classifying reviews and displaying a plot of rating distribution.
- **basic_sentiment_analysis.py**: This Python file demonstrates a basic example of sentiment analysis using the Hugging Face model.

## How Hugging Face's Sentiment Analysis Works
The project utilizes Hugging Face’s pipeline API to perform sentiment analysis. It uses the distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english model to classify text as either positive or negative.

python
classifier = pipeline('sentiment-analysis', model='distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english')


For example:
python
result = classifier("The food was great!")


This would return a sentiment classification with a confidence score.

## Running the Code

1. *Clone the Repository:*
   bash
   git clone <https://github.com/faisalaldwaish/Sentiment-Analysis-of-Restaurant-Reviews/tree/main>
   
   
   
 After running this command navigate the folder that you have save the repository at, then run full_review_sentiment_analysis.py file

## Expected Output

### Review Classifier
Input a review, and the classifier will return:
- A rating-based classification from the dataset.
- A sentiment analysis result from the Hugging Face model.
  
For example:

Positive review based on rating: 5
Model prediction: POSITIVE with confidence: 0.98
Matching Score: 90%
